<div class="markdown-converter__text--rendered"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>training set (train.csv)</li>
<li>test set (test.csv)</li>
</ul>
<p><b> The training set </b>provides the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger.</p>
<p><b>The test set </b>does not provide the ground truth for each passenger. For each passenger in the test set, predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>
