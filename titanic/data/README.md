<div class="markdown-converter__text--rendered"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>training set (train.csv)</li>
<li>test set (test.csv)</li>
</ul>
<p><b> The training set </b>provides the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger.</p>
<p><b>The test set </b>does not provide the ground truth for each passenger. For each passenger in the test set, predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>

<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br> 1st = Upper<br> 2nd = Middle<br> 3rd = Lower<br><br> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5<br><br> <b>sibsp</b>: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br> Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister<br> Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)<br><br> <b>parch</b>: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br> Parent = mother, father<br> Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson<br> Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.</p></div>
